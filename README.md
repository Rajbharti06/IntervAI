## Running the Application

To run the application, you can use Docker Compose or run the frontend and backend separately.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

From the root directory of the project, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and start both the frontend and backend services. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running Frontend and Backend Separately

**Backend:**

Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
